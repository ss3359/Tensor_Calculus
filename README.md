# Tensor_Calculus
This is a new repository that includes code implementing Tensor Calculus. This is a new repository that includes code implementing Tensor Calculus. This repository includes code on computing the metric tensor, inverse metric tensor, Christoffell symbols, and using the Runge-Kutta method to solve the Geodesic Equations. This will be updated to hopefully get to making a simulation of planets using Einsteins Field Equations from General Relativity. 
I hope you enjoy my code! Thank you for your help and support!
